# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've created a new Hugo blog, amended the theme, deployed it and written a blog post.

**Thoughts** I am liking Hugo and how fast it is. I'd be nice to have my own theme but I fell in love with the one I installed. Furthermore, it was nice to write a new post, I haven't written one in weeks.

### Day 2: August 18, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Added twitter cards to the blog so it would help drive traffic to the website and created The Good Place REST API with demo site

**Thoughts** I remember when I was doing random quotes generator task for FCC in the beginnings and it took me days to finish. Now, I have created a front end AND the API from scratch in couple of hours. And most of the time I spent on it, was to collect the quotes. Progress' real.

### Day 3: August 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started a new project - dashboard for all my heroku apps

**Thoughts** It was easier than anticipated, the API is really good. I had some troubles with promises but solved it. Currently stuck on design - it looks terrible atm but I started looking into CSS Grid. This is a perfect project to test it out on.

### Day 4: August 21, Tuesday

**Thoughts** none

### Day 5: August 22, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watched videos on cyber security 

**Thoughts** Still on the beginner level so it's very high level and I haven't really learned that much. Pretty much everything is someghing that I already knew or something that is pretty obvious. Still, cannot wait to continue and see what intermediate and advanced level have got to offer.

### Day 6: August 23, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a new blog post about clean code

**Thoughts** Ugh, missing last two examples but I'm too lazy to think of them. I'll finish them tmrw.

**Link(s) to work** not yet

### Day 7: August 24, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Went ahead and added GraphQl to Good Place REST API I created on day 2 and created a demo app for graphQL so demonstrate how to make request to graphQL enpoint.

**Thoughts** I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to query graphQL on client side. For some reason I expected something more difficult. Anyway, the API is now in a good place (pun not intended), I should maybe think about looking for some graphQL APIs list or something similar to showcase it to more people. Demo app picked up quite nicely, it was featured at glicth's weekly top app list. If I could do the same for API, it'd be nice.
