# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've created a new Hugo blog, amended the theme, deployed it and written a blog post.

**Thoughts** I am liking Hugo and how fast it is. I'd be nice to have my own theme but I fell in love with the one I installed. Furthermore, it was nice to write a new post, I haven't written one in weeks.

### Day 2: August 18, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Added twitter cards to the blog so it would help drive traffic to the website and created The Good Place REST API with demo site

**Thoughts** I remember when I was doing random quotes generator task for FCC in the beginnings and it took me days to finish. Now, I have created a front end AND the API from scratch in couple of hours. And most of the time I spent on it, was to collect the quotes. Progress' real.
