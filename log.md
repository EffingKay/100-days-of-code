# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've created a new Hugo blog, amended the theme, deployed it and written a blog post.

**Thoughts** I am liking Hugo and how fast it is. I'd be nice to have my own theme but I fell in love with the one I installed. Furthermore, it was nice to write a new post, I haven't written one in weeks.
